/// The `Services` struct is used for registering and storing a `Container`'s services.
///
/// # Registering Services
///
/// While the `Services` struct is mutable (before it is used to initialize a `Container`), new services
/// can be registered using a few different methods.
///
/// ## Factory
///
/// The most common method for registering services is by using a factory.
///
///     services.register(Logger.self) { container in
///         return PrintLogger()
///     }
///
/// This will ensure a new instance of your service is created for any `SubContainer`s. See the `register(_:factory:)`
/// methods for more information.
///
/// - note: You may need to disambiguate the closure return by adding `-> T`.
///
/// ## Type
///
/// A concise method for registering services is by using the `ServiceType` protocol. Types conforming
/// to this protocol can be registered to `Services` using just the type name.
///
///     extension PrintLogger: ServiceType { ... }
///
///     services.register(PrintLogger.self)
///
/// See `ServiceType` for more details.
///
/// ## Instance
///
/// You can also register pre-initialized instances of a service.
///
///     services.register(PrintLogger())
///
/// - warning: When used with reference types (classes), this method will share the same
///            object with all `SubContainer`s. Be careful to avoid race conditions.
///
/// # Making Services
///
/// Once you initialize a `Container` from a `Services` struct, the `Services` will become immutable.
/// After this point, you can use the `make(_:)` method on `Container` to start creating services.
///
/// - note: The `Services` are immutable on a `Container` to optimize caching.
///
/// See `Container` for more information.
