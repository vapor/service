///
/// `Provider`s have two phases:
///
/// - Registration
/// - Boot
///
/// ## Registration
///
/// During the registration phase, the `Provider` is supplied with a mutable `Services` struct. The `Provider`
/// is expected to register all services it would like to expose to the `Container` during this phase.
///
///     services.register(RedisCache.self)
///
/// ## Boot
///
/// There are two parts of the boot phase: `willBoot(_:)` and `didBoot(_:)`. Both of these methods supply
/// the `Provider` with access to the initialized `Container` and allow asynchronous work to be done.
///
/// The `didBoot(_:)` method is guaranteed to be called after all providers have run `willBoot(_:)`. Most providers should
/// try to do their work in the `didBoot(_:)` method, resorting to the `willBoot(_:)` method if they want to pre-empt work
/// done by other providers.
